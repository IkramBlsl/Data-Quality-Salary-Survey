## Description

In this project, we will explore and analyze the "Ask-A-Manager Salary Survey 2021" dataset, which contains salary data collected through an ongoing online survey conducted by Alison Green. The dataset includes responses to demographic, professional, and salary questions from approximately 27,000 records.

Objectives:

- Data Exploration: Compute and visualize various statistics of the dataset.
- Data Interpretation and Analysis: Identify and interpret the features of the dataset and discuss potential learning problems that can be addressed using this data.
- Data Quality Assessment: Identify data quality issues and propose solutions.
- Data Cleaning: Implement data cleaning methods to improve the quality of the dataset.
- Text Data Processing: Transform text variables into numerical values using NLP techniques.
- Data Transformation for Numeric Algorithms: Convert non-numeric data fields to numeric for algorithms that require numerical input.
- Data Transformation for Mixed Algorithms: Preprocess the dataset for machine learning algorithms that handle both numeric and categorical data.
- Manifold Learning: Apply manifold learning algorithms and evaluate the reconstruction error.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce data dimensions to 2D or 3D and analyze the results.
- Machine Learning Application: Apply a machine learning algorithm (classification, regression, clustering) and evaluate the results on different data embeddings.


## Requirements

Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, numpy , nltk, gensim
